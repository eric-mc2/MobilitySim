    "## Goals\n",
    "Implement the Durlauf-Seshadri model as a simulation, reproduce the expected stylized facts, identify causal mechanism, test implications of extending model or relaxing certain assumptions.\n",
    "## \n",
    "The paper's main arguments are 1) segregation causes and aggravates inequality 2) and that inequality decreases subsequent generations' mobility.\n",
    "## Stylized Facts\n",
    "* intertemporal great gadby curve emerges\n",
    "* permanent segregation without explicit poverty/affluence traps\n",
    "## Model Structure\n",
    "* income is certain and depends on child human capital\n",
    "* only two periods of life (child/get capital, adult/get income)\n",
    "* local public finance of schools\n",
    "* students in same school gain same amount of capital from school\n",
    "* parents prefer more affluent, larger neighborhoods\n",
    "* inequality increases segregation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Assumptions\n",
    "* local public finance of schools\n",
    "* no marriage or inter-family income sharing\n",
    "* one child, no elders, no population growth or shrink\n",
    "* no direct parental investment (only via neighborhood)\n",
    "* parental utility depends on child expected income, not on child expected utility or human capital\n",
    "* no credit constraint\n",
    "## Further Directions\n",
    "* alternative mechanisms for mobility:\n",
    "    * credit constraints\n",
    "    * productivity of parent capital investment in child depends on parent capital level\n",
    "    * other ways for heterogenous AR\n",
    "* peer effects in capital development\n",
    "* role model effects in capital development\n"
