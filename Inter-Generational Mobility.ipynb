    "## Goals\n",
    "Implement the Durlauf-Seshadri model as a simulation, reproduce the expected stylized facts, identify causal mechanism, test implications of extending model or relaxing certain assumptions.\n",
    "## Argument\n",
    "The paper's main arguments are 1) segregation causes and aggravates inequality 2) and that inequality decreases subsequent generations' mobility.\n",
    "## Stylized Facts\n",
    "* intertemporal great gadby curve emerges\n",
    "## Key Assumptions\n",
    "* no marriage or inter-family income sharing\n",
    "* one child, no elders, no population growth or shrink\n",
    "* income is certain and fully attained at time of child investment (no credit constraint)\n",
    "* no direct parental investment (only via neighborhood)\n",
    "* parental utility depends on child expected income, not on child expected utility or human capital\n",
    "## Interesting Questions\n",
    "* credit constraints are an alternative identifiable mechanism"
